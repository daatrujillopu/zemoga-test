# Zemoga-Test

Hi! evaluator, in this repository you will find test you sent me ([https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test](https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test)).

I used these technologies to perform the test

 - **Html5** tags as aside, header, footer, section
 - **Sass** Preprocessors
 - **ReactJs** as library to create components to encapsulate differents parts of the main page
 - **react-scripts-app** to create a react app and create a developement enviroment
 - **Local Storage** to store and persist data on browser

to see this code in action, run the following lines in your terminal

npm :

    npm install
    npm start

yarn:

    yarn
    yarn start

 **Thanks for the opportunity,** iÂ´ll waiting for all comments that you have

***Have a good day***
